## [Unreleased] — 0.4.0-dev

Phases 0–4: foundation, panel, agent, server dashboard and read-only discovery.

### Added
- **Foundation:** repository layout, MIT license, contribution and security
  policies, architecture and operations documentation, CI workflow, Makefile,
  development environment (`scripts/dev.sh`) with a fixture server.
- **Panel (PHP 8.3+):** dependency-free MVC core (container, router, views,
  middleware), SQLite with migrations, session authentication with Argon2id,
  login throttling, CSRF protection, strict Content-Security-Policy, RBAC with
  Administrator/Operator/Viewer roles, panel user management with
  last-administrator protection, settings, audit log, profile and password
  change (other sessions are invalidated), friendly error pages with
  reference IDs, CLI (`bin/whacp`).
- **Agent (Go):** Unix-socket API with bearer token and SO_PEERCRED checks,
  named action registry with a write gate (`allow_write_actions`, off),
  uniform response envelope, OS abstraction (Debian family; RHEL scaffold),
  metrics collector with history, service status via systemd, allowlisted
  command runner (no shell), secret redaction, OpenAPI description.
- **Dashboard:** live CPU, memory, disk, load, network charts and service
  state; server information page; services page.
- **Read-only discovery:** Nginx configuration parser (includes, symlinks,
  disabled sites), websites correlated with PHP-FPM pools and certificates,
  PHP versions and pools, Let's Encrypt lineages, MySQL/MariaDB schemas from
  the data directory (no credentials), Redis, cron (secrets redacted), system
  accounts, firewall state; snapshots with checksum history; heuristics
  detecting sites managed by other panels.
- **Installer:** OS/requirement/conflict checks, `--dry-run`, hardened
  systemd units (agent filesystem is read-only), loopback-only panel,
  first-administrator creation, health checks, uninstaller.
