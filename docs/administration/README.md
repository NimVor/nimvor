# Administration

## Roles and permissions

| Role | Intended for | Can |
|------|--------------|-----|
| Administrator | owners | everything |
| Operator | day-to-day operations | view everything, run discovery, read the audit log |
| Viewer | read-only stakeholders | dashboard, server, services, websites, PHP, databases, SSL |

Permissions are defined in code (`panel/app/Security/Permissions.php`) and
synchronised into the database by `bin/whacp migrate`. At least one active
administrator must always exist: the panel refuses to delete, disable or
demote the last one. Users cannot delete or disable themselves.

## Sessions and sign-in

- Passwords: Argon2id, minimum 12 characters, must not contain the username.
- Throttling: 5 failures per username or 10 per IP in 15 minutes lock sign-in.
- Sessions end after the idle timeout (setting) or 12 hours, and immediately
  when the user's password changes or the account is disabled.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Panel name | WhaCP | header and title |
| Session idle timeout | 30 min | 5–1440 |
| Discovery cache | 300 s | 0 = always ask the agent |
| Dashboard refresh | 10 s | 3–300 |
| Certificate warning | 14 days | highlight threshold |

Infrastructure settings (paths, cookies, proxies) are in `/etc/whacp/panel.php`.

## Audit log

Recorded: sign-in success/failure/throttling, sign-out, CSRF rejections,
access denials, user create/update/delete, password changes and resets,
settings changes, manual discovery runs. Each entry has user, action, target,
result, IP, user agent and redacted details. Filter by action prefix
(e.g. `user.`), user, result or free text.

## Discovery

*Server → Discovery* shows counts, warnings encountered while reading
configuration, and snapshot history. **Re-scan** asks the agent for a fresh
inventory; it only reads. A changed checksum between snapshots means the
server configuration changed.

## CLI

```bash
export WHACP_CONFIG=/etc/whacp/panel.php
sudo -u whacp -E php /opt/whacp/panel/bin/whacp migrate
sudo -u whacp -E php /opt/whacp/panel/bin/whacp user:create alice alice@example.com --role=operator
sudo -u whacp -E php /opt/whacp/panel/bin/whacp user:password alice
sudo -u whacp -E php /opt/whacp/panel/bin/whacp agent:check
sudo -u whacp -E php /opt/whacp/panel/bin/whacp discovery:run
```
